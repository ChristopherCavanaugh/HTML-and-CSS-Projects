# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

This is the display of sample websites I made while learning HTML and CSS.

Projects:

Space Station Site:
This page is an example home page for a space travel company. It is styled using CSS and contains 
a navbar, image containers, and a form.

Movie Theatre site:
This page is an example home page for a Movie theatre that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It
contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form,
cards, and dropdowns.
