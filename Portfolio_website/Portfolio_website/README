This is the display of my portfolio website I made while learning HTML and CSS and JavaScript.

Project: Portfolio website
It is styled using CSS and made dynamic with JavaScript.

This website will provide a way to communicate and connect with me, view my Github and LinkedIN as well as provide the skillsets I have.
